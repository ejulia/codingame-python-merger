#### ℹ️ codingame-python-merger is a tool that allows the [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/home) players to organize their Python code into multiple files. It is best used with the [CodinGame Sync app and extension](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614) to push your code automatically to the plateform's editor. ℹ️
---

During the CodinGame AI competitions, the bot code can become quite big for a single file. This project lets you organize your Python code into multiple files, and automatically merge these into a single file that you can either copy or push to the CodinGame online editor.

Have fun!


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that Python 2+ is installed and running on your machine.


## Installing codingame-python-merger

* Just clone this project on your computer, and start coding your bot!
* If you want to use the [CodinGame Sync App](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614), the file to sync with is `merge.py` (not `merger.py`).


## Using codingame-python-merger

* Only the code written in the `main/` directory will be appended to the `merge.py` file.
* In the `main/` directory, you can organize your code in as many sub-directories as you wish.
* Only the `*.py` files will be merged, links (either symbolic or real) and files with another or no extension will be ignored.
* The `main.py` file is appended last to the `merge.py` file, hence that is where your main code should be written.
* When you are ready, execute the `merger.py` script. It will automatically merge all the appropriate files in the `merge.py` file. Library imports are managed during the process. If you are using the [CodinGame Sync App](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614), your code should be automatically pushed to the CodinGame online editor once when the merge is complete.

* If you want to unit-test your code, use the `test/` directory. The code there won't be appended to the merge.py file.
